General
=======

- All templates should probably have CHANGES file placeholders.
- All templates should have a rule for generating README.html.

Arduino
=======
- https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/integration/platformio/
- https://learn.adafruit.com/continuous-integration-arduino-and-you/testing-your-project
- https://github.com/adafruit/travis-ci-arduino

Ruby
====

- Unify README file conventions for Ruby projects.
- Makefile: standard rules for making README, at least.

OCaml
=====

- Fix the ``make install`` target for correct prefix/DESTDIR support.
- Implement the ``make check`` target: how to test OCaml packages?
- Figure out what should go into .ocp-indent.
- Improve on DRY aspects for META.in, Makefile, foobar.install; ideally,
  there should be a way to obtain metadata fields from foobar.opam for use
  in generating the other files. Don't hardcode $PACKAGE_NAME in Makefile.
- Improve the ``make clean`` target.
- Figure out if it's possible to not hardcode "version" in foobar.opam.

- .cmi (compiled interface file)
